Hello! Glad to see my homework repo is still being used. Maybe check out some of the other garbage I have kicking around on here?

Pro tips for getting an A in Prof Kirk's class. 

    1. Study those 200 slide powerpoints like the bible
    2. When studying go for understanding the content, not memorizing
    3. Master git and design patterns. 
    4. You dont realize it now, but java streams are king. 

This is lab number 8
